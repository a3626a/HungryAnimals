# Changing Mob Drops

With Hungry Animals, cows drop more than **30+ meats** by default. It is because HA cows are considered more expensive than vanilla cows. They have more hp, eat a lot, and grow slowly.

There are some methods to change this behavior. First one is **Easy Config**. Next is **Master Config**. The last one is **changing loot tables**.

## Easy Config

{% page-ref page="../basics/master-config.md" %}

You can easily make it`"tempo": "fast"` . This config make animals less expensive, make cows drop **12 meats**, pigs drop 3 meats.

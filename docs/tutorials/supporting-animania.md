# Supporting Animania

## Introduction

\(...\)

## What Happens When Both HA And Animania Are Installed?

HA loads bunch of internal configurations for Animania. It consists of registration, AI, attributes, and food preferences.

### Registration

Unfortunately, Animania has its own food, taming, and breeding system. So the default configurations turn off HA's feature. Taming, Mating, Weight, and Aging are disabled.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="animal.json" %}
```text
[
  ...
  {
    "name": "animania:hog_hampshire",
    "tamable": false,
    "model_growing": false,
    "sexual": false,
    "hungry": false,
    "ageable": false
  },
  ...
]

```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For the details about `animal.json`, refer this document. 

{% page-ref page="../basics/animal-registry.md" %}
{% endhint %}

### Attributes

Default configs are generated by copying vanilla configs. It includes max health and move speed changes. Therefore Animania animals with HA have higher health than animals of Animania alone. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For the details,

{% page-ref page="../attributes/attributes.md" %}
{% endhint %}

### AI

{% hint style="info" %}
{% page-ref page="../ais/ais.md" %}
{% endhint %}

Most AIs are disabled because many features are disabled during registration. Only defense AI is active which makes cows to avenge attackers.

### Food Preferences

Food preferences are included in default configurations, but they are inactive because weight system is disabled. \(`"hungry": false`\)

{% endhint %}

## Useful HA Features

### Productions

HA provides production customization. In this article, we will add milk production to Hampshire.

{% page-ref page="../productions/productions.md" %}
{% endhint %}

#### Adding Milk Production

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="config/hungryanimals/productions/animania/sow\_hampshire.json" %}
```text
[
  {
    "type": "fluid",
    "name": "animania.pig.milk",
    "condition": {
    },
    "fluid": "milk",
    "capacity": 3000,
    "amount": 1,
    "weight": 0
  }
]
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

This production entry will make every sow produce milk. Because fluid production requires certain attributes, you should register new attributes to them.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="config/hungryanimals/attributes/animania/sow\_hampshire.json" %}
```text
{
  ...
  "hungryanimals.fluid_amount": 4,
  "hungryanimals.fluid_weight": 0.0
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

### Loot Tables

HA provides loot table customization. You can add custom drops to animals. No document for loot tables now.

### AIs

HA provides complicated AI customization. Because most features are disabled, there are just a few useful things.

#### Making Animals Defensive

Refer `config/hungryanimals_example/ais/minecraft/cows.json`.

#### Making Animals Running Away

To enable this, taming system should be enabled. It is because without taming system, every animals are considered as domesticated. Taming systems from HA and Animania are not compatible now. You should tame animals in both method.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="config/hungryanimals/animal.json" %}
```text
[
  ...
  {
    "name": "animania:hog_hampshire",
    "tamable": true,
    "model_growing": false,
    "sexual": false,
    "hungry": false,
    "ageable": false
  },
  ...
]
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}
